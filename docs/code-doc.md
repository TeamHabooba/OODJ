### Documentation requirements (for both `.md` and `Javadoc`)
- Specify all your classes.  
- State a data type of each class field.  
- State a return data type and argument data types of each class method.  
- Don't forget to mention `static` keyword if used in method signature.  
- Give a brief explanation to all the fields and methods.
Except for the self-documenting ones.
E.g. you _don't_ need to explain the `private int age` field of class `Student`.
- Both getters and setters for the same field _can_ be described in one line.
Example:
"`public void setAge(int age)` and `public int getAge()` - `int age` field accessors."

_Will be adjusted in future_
