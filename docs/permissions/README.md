All backend methods must be banned from access without
permission.
All permissions must be documented in this (`docs/permissions/...`) folder.
Documentation must include `name` and might include `description` for
better understanding.

Permission name format must be as following:  
- `allow_do_sth` - for boolean permissions;
- `power_do_sth` - for integer permissions.
