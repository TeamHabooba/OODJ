## Methodology
For small but unstable projects like our assignments it's better
to use one of Agile methodologies. Our team is using Kanban
methodology.

Here's what ChatGPT says about Kanban:
> Kanban is an Agile project management method focused on
> visualizing work, limiting work in progress (WIP), 
> and improving flow.  
> 
> Key Principles:  
> - Visualize the workflow — tasks are shown on a Kanban board,
> typically divided into columns like To Do → In Progress → Done.
> - Limit Work in Progress (WIP) — each stage has a maximum 
> number of tasks allowed to prevent overload.
> - Manage flow — the goal is to keep work moving smoothly and
> identify bottlenecks.
> - Make process policies explicit — everyone knows how work
> is prioritized and moved.
> - Continuously improve — teams adjust workflows based on 
> data and feedback.
> 
> Characteristics:  
> - No fixed iterations (unlike Scrum).
> - Continuous delivery — tasks are completed as soon as they’re ready.
> - Flexible priorities — tasks can be added or reordered anytime.
>
> Example:  
> A typical Kanban board might look like:  
> [To Do] → [In Progress] → [Review] → [Done]

For our team Kanban workflow would be supported via
GitHub Projects. _All the tasks on Kanban board are called
`Issues` here_.  
You can open a GitHub Project with our Kanban board
[here](https://github.com/orgs/TeamHabooba/projects/2).
You can also access it if you go to 
[TeamHabooba](https://github.com/TeamHabooba) 
account on GitHub, then go to 
[Projects](https://github.com/orgs/TeamHabooba/projects).  
Our methodology is a bit different from the standard
Kanban. All the specifics are explained below.

### Board
We have 5 stages:
- Backlog
- Ready
- In progress
- Review
- Done

Backlog. All the tasks that should be completed first get
created here.   
Each member would have one Module allocated
as an initial task. Module is an Issue with Type: Task, Priority: P2, Size: XL,
Start Date: 01.11.2025 and Target Date: 29.11.2025.  
Every time when you decide to do part of your Module, please
press on Module name, then `Create a sub-issue`. This would 
be your task.


### Priority
### Size
### Dates
### Assignee

## Warnings
### General
Each group member might be warned if task wasn't
submitted on time.   
In this case, member's warning count
would be increased by 1 and task deadline would be postponed
by 2 calendar days.   
Once member reaches warning cap, they are reported to
the assignment supervisor and asked to leave the group.

Group warning cap equals **5 (FIVE)**. Might be increased or
decreased based on team workload.
